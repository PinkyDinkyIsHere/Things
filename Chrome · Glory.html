During <strong>Frost Soul</strong> mode, all 3 orb combos will grant Chrome <strong>Body Frost</strong> mode and does not consume <strong>Shield of Glory</strong>. <strong>Shield of Glory</strong> does not recover overtime within <strong>Frost Soul</strong> mode. Chrome radiates <strong>Frost Soul Radiation</strong> when within <strong>Frost Soul</strong> mode, dealing 79.41% ice damage per 0.5 second and inflicting <strong>Frost Crystal Corrosion</strong> which lowers target’s ice resistance by 5%, last for 8 seconds, inflicting it again refreshes the duration</p>
